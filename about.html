            <p> <span class="written-content">I'm a postgraduate cyber security student currently working towards completing an <u>MSc in Applied Cyber Security</u> at Queen's University Belfast. I recieved a <u>BSc in mathematics and Computer Science</u> from the University of St Andrews in 2022. Within cyber security, my main interests include: offensive security and ethical hacking; the mathematics of cryptography; and multidisciplinary topics within the subject such as GDPR and related legislation, surveillance, personal privacy, and the role of the state in cyber security. </span> </p>

            <p><span class="written-content">As well as cyber security I also have knowledge and experience in software engineering, and have good command over several programming langauges inluding <u>Python</u>, <u>JavaScript/Typescript</u>, <u> Java </u>, and <u>C/C++</u>. I'm also interested in the relationship between technology and culture, especially the impact that the internet has had on how people communicate, interact, and experience the world. You can see a list of projects I've worked on or completed in my portfolio, </span><a href="./portfolio.html">[here]</a><span class="written-content">.</span></p>
            <p><span class="written-content"> My time spent not at the computer is generally spent in the outdoors.
